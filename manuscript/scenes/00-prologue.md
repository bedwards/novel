# Prologue

I fed the dog first—that's how they got me. Everyone remembers that part, the kindness that preceded the rest, as if charity could inoculate against what came after. The dog was three-legged, shivering in the alley behind Kepler's Bar where I'd stopped to piss at 2 AM, and I gave it half a sandwich I'd been saving. My father would have called this weakness. He'd been dead six months and I could still hear him. Soft, he would have said. Always so fucking soft.

When Mara appeared from the bar's back door with two men I didn't recognize, she was wearing a dress I thought I remembered from years ago, from when we were seventeen, some summer night in her mother's garden shed, mosquitoes against the screens and her skin smelling like the jasmine that grew wild along the fence. Before I understood she was already planning to leave. Before I understood anything. She said it exactly the way my father would have: "Soft. Always so fucking soft." The taller man behind her had a gun and the shorter one was holding my wallet, which I'd left on the bar while helping that dog, and this was stupidity, not nobility, though I'd drunk enough to find the distinction meaningless.

The taller man handed the gun to Mara. "Knee-cap him," he said. Not asking. Testing. She turned and shot the dog instead—not me, the dog—one clean pop. The animal didn't even yelp, just folded into itself like paper cranes collapse when you don't crease them right. I thought: this is how I'll remember her, not the garden shed or the promises about Paris, but this. Her choosing the easy cruelty over the hard one. She'd always been steady like that, even when we were children, when she first explained that love was a transaction. She'd been steady and I'd believed her because I was fifteen and stupid.

The taller man grabbed my shoulder and his hand was changing. I saw this clearly even drunk—the fingers lengthening, nails darkening to claws, the whole shape of it shifting like meat does when it spoils in time-lapse. He was halfway between what he'd been and what he was becoming. Not metaphor. I'd heard stories about the Converted, people who'd crossed over and come back altered, but I'd assumed they were stories in the way you assume anything sufficiently strange is a story until it's standing in front of you with its hand on your shoulder turning into something with claws.

"The professor said you'd know where it is," the shorter man said, meaning Dr. Zheng, my mentor, who'd called me three days earlier to say he was sorry, that he'd given them my name when they'd started breaking his fingers. When I picked up the phone his voice had been hoarse, wrecked, and I could hear him breathing through his mouth like his nose was broken. I was back there suddenly, at the faculty dinner six months ago, the night Zheng had told us about the nested worlds.

The restaurant was called Paradiso, which I remembered thinking was pretentious even before we'd ordered, and it had those red and white checkered tablecloths that are supposed to signal authenticity but mostly just signal that someone's idea of Italian comes from watching too many movies. The wine was decent though, or maybe it just tasted decent after the second glass, which is when things started getting loose and expansive in the way faculty dinners do when everyone's had enough to stop performing their academic selves but not enough to become embarrassing. Zheng was across from me, next to someone's wife—Robertson's wife maybe, or was it Anderson's—a woman whose name I've forgotten but who laughed too loud at everything, that kind of desperate laughter that sounds like it's trying to escape from something. She was wearing too much perfume. I remember that. Something floral and cloying that mixed badly with the garlic bread.

Zheng was on his third glass of wine, possibly his fourth. He got expansive after three glasses, philosophical, and this was the expansive Zheng, the one who leaned across the table with his elbows nearly in someone else's pasta and talked with his hands moving like he was conducting an invisible orchestra. "There are other places," he said, and someone groaned because drunk Zheng always had theories about other places, other dimensions, other states of consciousness that he'd never quite articulate properly because he was drunk. But he kept going. "Nested one inside the other like Russian dolls, each one containing the next, and you can go down if you know the way." 

Robertson—I'm fairly sure it was Robertson—made a joke about Narnia and wardrobes, and Anderson said something about Dante and circles of hell, and we all laughed because that's what you do when a drunk colleague starts talking about metaphysics at a faculty dinner. You laugh and you pour more wine and you hope he'll change the subject before it gets awkward. The waitress came by with more bread. I remember her because she had a tattoo on her wrist, something in a language I didn't recognize, and she moved between the tables like she was trying not to be noticed, like she was practicing invisibility.

But Zheng wasn't laughing. He had that look he got sometimes, that serious look that was almost frightening in how much it contrasted with the wine-drunk flush on his face. "My grandfather crossed over once," he said, and the table got quieter, not silent but quieter, the kind of quiet where people are still chewing and drinking but they're also listening in that way you listen when you're not sure if something's a joke or not. "Came back three days later." He paused here, refilled his glass even though it was still half full, took a drink like he needed the fortification. "He told me once, when I was sixteen—just once, he'd never talk about it otherwise—he said the world we thought was solid was just the surface. That beneath it there were other worlds stacked like layers of sediment, and if you knew where to look, if you had the right key or the right words or the right state of mind—he wasn't clear on that part, he kept changing the terms—you could slip down through the cracks between them."

Someone—maybe it was Patterson, the visiting professor from Toronto—said that sounded like a stroke or early-onset dementia, saying it gently the way you do when you're trying to redirect a conversation without being cruel about it. But Zheng shook his head. "He lived another forty years after that. Healthy. Sharp."

The waitress was back, asking if anyone wanted dessert. No one did. Someone asked for the check. The woman whose name I've forgotten laughed at something, too loud again, trying to break the heaviness that had settled over the table. But I was watching Zheng's face, and he was somewhere else entirely, somewhere none of us could follow, and I remember thinking that he believed this, really believed it, that his grandfather had gone somewhere else and come back changed and that the world had cracks in it you could slip through if you knew how to look.

Mara's voice pulled me back, her voice and the pressure of the gun against my temple which had been there the whole time I was gone, the whole time I was back at that dinner which felt like it had lasted hours but couldn't have been more than seconds. "Your father left you the key."

The gun lowered. "Show us where it is," Mara said.

"I don't know what you're talking about," I said, which was true in the sense that I didn't know what the hell they wanted with my father's key, false in that I knew I'd give it to them anyway. Cowardice or pragmatism—another distinction without meaning.

I remembered Zheng's face that night, how serious he'd been under the wine, how he'd looked like a man who'd seen something he couldn't unsee. And I was thinking about my father, who'd never mentioned nested worlds or crossing over, who'd been a drunk and a cynic and a bastard, but who'd left me something in his will that I hadn't understood. A key, the lawyer had said. Just a key, no explanation, no box or lock or instruction, just a brass key on a leather cord that I'd shoved in a drawer and forgotten about.

They marched me through empty early morning streets, past closed shops and the occasional person sleeping in a doorway. The dog-man's claws clicked on the pavement. The shorter man kept his hand on something in his jacket pocket. Mara grabbed my hand, gruff, holding the gun now in her other hand across her body pointing at my ribs, but after a block or two her grasp softened and she allowed the gun to drop by her side, though her grip on my hand stayed firm, like she needed to hold onto something real while the dog-man led us through streets that were starting to feel less and less like the streets I knew.

The dog-man kept stopping to look at the street lamps. Not the old gas ones—those were all gone now, converted years ago—but the modern electric ones, LED bulbs that cast a different kind of light entirely, whiter, harsher. He'd stop under each one and look up at it like he was trying to understand something.

"What the fuck are you doing?" the shorter man said after the third or fourth time this happened. His voice had an edge to it, like he was trying to stay calm and failing.

The dog-man didn't answer. He was looking at the light, his transformed face doing something that might have been thinking or might have been remembering.

"We don't have time for this," the shorter man said, louder now. "We need to—"

"Whale oil," the dog-man said. His voice was mostly growl now but still comprehensible. "They used to burn whale oil in the lamps. Street lamps. Cities full of them, all burning whale oil. Someone's job to fill each one, every night."

The shorter man looked at Mara like he was asking permission to do something violent. Mara shook her head slightly, her hand tightening on mine.

"I was at sea once," the dog-man continued. "We came upon a whaling ship. The *Petrel*, out of Nantucket. They had a whale alongside, still alive. Bleeding. They were cutting it while it was still breathing."

"I don't give a shit about—" the shorter man started.

"The water was red," the dog-man said. "The whole ocean around the ship was red, and the whale was making sounds, low sounds like it was trying to speak but didn't have the right mouth for it. And I thought: this is for the lamps. This whole animal, this thing that's bigger than most houses, dying in the ocean so that people in cities can have light in their streets. So they can walk safely at night. So they can see where they're going."

He stopped under the next lamp post, completely stopped, not just pausing but frozen, staring up into the light like it was showing him something we couldn't see. The shorter man grabbed his arm, yanked it, tried to pull him forward, but the dog-man wouldn't budge. He reached up with his clawed hand and started scratching at the post, long scraping sounds, metal on metal, leaving marks in the paint.

"Move," the shorter man said, yanking harder. "Fucking move."

The dog-man didn't move. He kept scratching, kept staring up into the light, and then he started speaking again, but different now, like he wasn't talking to us anymore, like he was talking to himself or to something else entirely.

"We'd been tracking them for two days," he said. "The *Petrel*."

The shorter man let go of his arm, stepped back. Mara's hand was trembling in mine now, just slightly, enough that I could feel it.

The dog-man kept talking.
