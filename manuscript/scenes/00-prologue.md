# Prologue

I fed the dog first—that's how they got me. Everyone remembers that part, the kindness that preceded the rest, as if charity could inoculate against what came after. The dog was three-legged, shivering in the alley behind Kepler's Bar where I'd stopped to piss at 2 AM, and I gave it half a sandwich I'd been saving. My father would have called this weakness. He'd been dead six months and I could still hear him. Soft, he would have said. Always so fucking soft.

When Mara appeared from the bar's back door with two men I didn't recognize, she was wearing a dress I thought I remembered from years ago, from when we were seventeen, some summer night in her mother's garden shed, mosquitoes against the screens and her skin smelling like the jasmine that grew wild along the fence. Before I understood she was already planning to leave. Before I understood anything. She said it exactly the way my father would have: "Soft. Always so fucking soft." The taller man behind her had a gun and the shorter one was holding my wallet, which I'd left on the bar while helping that dog, and this was stupidity, not nobility, though I'd drunk enough to find the distinction meaningless.

"Kill him," the taller man said to Mara. Not asking. Testing. She turned and shot the dog instead—not me, the dog—one clean pop. The animal didn't even yelp, just folded into itself like bad origami or like how paper cranes collapse when you don't crease them right. I thought: this is how I'll remember her, not the garden shed or the promises about Paris, but this. Her choosing the easy cruelty over the hard one. She'd always been steady like that, even when we were children, when she first explained that love was a transaction. She'd been steady and I'd believed her because I was fifteen and stupid.

The taller man grabbed my shoulder and his hand was changing. I saw this clearly even drunk—the fingers lengthening, nails darkening to claws, the whole shape of it shifting like meat does when it spoils in time-lapse. He was halfway between what he'd been and what he was becoming. Not metaphor. I'd heard stories about the Converted, people who'd crossed over and come back altered, but I'd assumed they were stories in the way you assume anything sufficiently strange is a story until it's standing in front of you with its hand on your shoulder turning into something with claws.

"The professor said you'd know where it is," the shorter man said, meaning Dr. Zheng, my mentor, who'd called me three days earlier to say he was sorry, that he'd given them my name when they'd started breaking Zheng's fingers. His own fingers. He'd apologized for giving me up while they were breaking his hands.

I said I didn't know what they were talking about, which was true in the sense that I didn't know what they wanted, false in that I knew I'd give it to them anyway. Cowardice or pragmatism—another distinction without meaning.

Mara pressed the gun against my temple. "Your father left you something." Her hand was steady. It had always been steady.

I was back there suddenly.

The restaurant was called Paradiso, which I remembered thinking was pretentious even before we'd ordered, and it had those red and white checkered tablecloths that are supposed to signal authenticity but mostly just signal that someone's idea of Italian comes from watching too many movies. The wine was decent though, or maybe it just tasted decent after the second glass, which is when things started getting loose and expansive in the way faculty dinners do when everyone's had enough to stop performing their academic selves but not enough to become embarrassing. Zheng was across from me, next to someone's wife—Robertson's wife maybe, or was it Anderson's—a woman whose name I've forgotten but who laughed too loud at everything, that kind of desperate laughter that sounds like it's trying to escape from something. She was wearing too much perfume. I remember that. Something floral and cloying that mixed badly with the garlic bread.

Zheng was on his third glass of wine, possibly his fourth. He got expansive after three glasses, philosophical, and this was the expansive Zheng, the one who leaned across the table with his elbows nearly in someone else's pasta and talked with his hands moving like he was conducting an invisible orchestra. "There are other places," he said, and someone groaned because drunk Zheng always had theories about other places, other dimensions, other states of consciousness that he'd never quite articulate properly because he was drunk. But he kept going. "Nested one inside the other like Russian dolls, each one containing the next, and you can go down if you know the way." 

Robertson—I'm fairly sure it was Robertson—made a joke about Nardia and wardrobes, and Anderson said something about Dante and circles of hell, and we all laughed because that's what you do when a drunk colleague starts talking about metaphysics at a faculty dinner. You laugh and you pour more wine and you hope he'll change the subject before it gets awkward. The waitress came by with more bread. I remember her because she had a tattoo on her wrist, something in a language I didn't recognize, and she moved between the tables like she was trying not to be noticed, like she was practicing invisibility.

But Zheng wasn't laughing. He had that look he got sometimes, that serious look that was almost frightening in how much it contrasted with the wine-drunk flush on his face. "My grandfather crossed over once," he said, and the table got quieter, not silent but quieter, the kind of quiet where people are still chewing and drinking but they're also listening in that way you listen when you're not sure if something's a joke or not. "Came back three days later. Wouldn't talk about what he'd seen. Not to his wife, not to his children. My father said he was altered. That's the word he used. Altered. Like he'd been changed at some fundamental level that you couldn't quite see but you could feel when you were in the room with him."

Someone—maybe it was Patterson, the visiting professor from Toronto—said that sounded like a stroke or early-onset dementia, saying it gently the way you do when you're trying to redirect a conversation without being cruel about it. But Zheng shook his head. "He lived another forty years. Healthy. Sharp. He just wouldn't talk about those three days, except once, when my father was sixteen and asked him directly what happened. He said the world we thought was solid was just the surface. That beneath it—" and here Zheng paused, refilled his glass even though it was still half full, took a drink like he needed the fortification, "—beneath it there were other worlds stacked like layers of sediment, and if you knew where to look, if you had the right key or the right words or the right state of mind—he wasn't clear on that part, he kept changing the terms—you could slip down through the cracks between them."

The waitress was back, asking if anyone wanted dessert. No one did. Someone asked for the check. The woman whose name I've forgotten laughed at something, too loud again, trying to break the heaviness that had settled over the table. But I was watching Zheng's face, and he was somewhere else entirely, somewhere none of us could follow, and I remember thinking that he believed this, really believed it, that his grandfather had gone somewhere else and come back changed and that the world had cracks in it you could slip through if you knew how to look.

Mara's voice pulled me back, her voice and the pressure of the gun against my temple which had been there the whole time I was gone, the whole time I was back at that dinner which felt like it had lasted hours but couldn't have been more than seconds. "The key your father left. You know what I'm talking about."

"That's not real," I said, but I was thinking about Zheng's face that night, how serious he'd been under the wine, how he'd looked like a man who'd seen something he couldn't unsee.

The taller man's transformation completed while I was saying this. He was dog now, or dog-shaped, teeth like porcelain knives, and the three-legged corpse at my feet had been his practice run, his becoming. He looked at me with something like pity and said, "Nothing's real until it eats you," his voice already sliding into growl, already losing the consonants.

Mara pulled the trigger. I heard the click, then nothing. The gun jammed, or she'd never loaded it, or this was all another test in a series of tests that began when I fed that fucking dog and would end—I could see it now—with me descending through realities I hadn't believed in until thirty seconds ago, hunting for something my father had hidden because he knew I'd be fool enough to look.

She lowered the gun. She was right. She'd always been right. That was the problem.

I looked at the dog's body at my feet. I'd fed it first. That had to count for something.

"Now we drop," the man said, his muzzle already pushing through his face.

The alley floor opened beneath us, which should have been impossible but wasn't, and I fell into the first of many realms.
