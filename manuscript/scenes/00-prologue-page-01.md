# Prologue - Page 1

I fed the dog first—that's how they got me. Everyone remembers that part, the kindness that preceded the rest, as if charity could inoculate against what came after. The dog was three-legged, shivering in the alley behind Kepler's Bar where I'd stopped to piss at 2 AM, and I gave it half a sandwich I'd been saving. My father would have called this weakness. He'd been dead six months and I could still hear him.

"Soft," Mara said, appearing from the bar's back door with two men I didn't recognize. Her dress was the same one she'd worn at seventeen when we'd first slept together in her mother's garden shed, before everything. Before I knew she was already planning to leave. "Always so fucking soft."

The taller man—Viktor, though I wouldn't learn his name until the trial—had a gun. The shorter one had my wallet, which I'd left on the bar while helping that dog. This was stupidity, not nobility, and in my defense I'd drunk enough to find the distinction meaningless.

"Kill him," Viktor said to Mara. Not asking. Testing.

She shot the dog instead. One clean pop. The animal didn't even yelp, just folded into itself like bad origami. I watched this happen and thought: this is how I'll remember her, not the garden shed or the promises she'd made about Paris, but this. Her choosing the easy cruelty over the hard one.

"There's your hero's journey," she said to me, almost gentle. She'd read Campbell in college, knew I had too. "Every story needs a murder."

Viktor grabbed my shoulder. His hand was changing—I saw this clearly even drunk—the fingers lengthening, nails darkening to claws. He was halfway between what he'd been and what he was becoming. This was not metaphor. I'd heard stories about the Converted, but assumed they were stories.

"The professor said you'd know where it is," the shorter man said. He meant Dr. Zheng, my mentor, who'd called me three days earlier to say he was sorry, that he'd given them my name when they'd started breaking his fingers. Betrayal is just the friend you haven't met yet, my father used to say. He was good at aphorisms, less good at staying sober.

"I don't know what you're talking about," I said, which was true in the sense that I didn't know what they wanted, false in that I knew I'd give it to them anyway. Cowardice or pragmatism—another distinction without meaning.

Mara pressed the gun against my temple. Her hand was steady. She'd been steady since we were children, since the day she'd explained that love was a transaction and I'd believed her because I was fifteen and stupid.

"Your father left you something," she said. "The key to the Third Realm."

The Third Realm. Zheng had mentioned it once, drunk at faculty dinner, said it like a joke. I'd laughed. We'd all laughed.

"That's not real," I said.

Viktor's transformation completed. He was dog now, or dog-shaped, teeth like porcelain knives. The three-legged corpse at my feet had been his practice run, his becoming. He looked at me with something like pity.

"Nothing's real until it eats you," he said, and his voice was already going, already sliding into growl.

Mara pulled the trigger. I heard the click, then nothing. The gun jammed, or she'd never loaded it, or this was all another test in a series of tests that began when I fed that fucking dog and would end—I could see it now, see the shape of what was coming—with me descending through realities I hadn't believed in until thirty seconds ago, hunting for something my father had hidden because he knew I'd be fool enough to look.

"You see how this works?" she asked, lowering the gun. "Every element. Sex, death, transformation, the reluctant hero. I told them you'd need the full treatment. The grand narrative all at once, like pulling off a bandage."

She was right. She'd always been right. That was the problem.

"The dog was the B-plot," I said, understanding.

"The dog is always the B-plot," Viktor said, his muzzle already pushing through his face. "Now we drop."

The alley floor opened beneath us, which should have been impossible but wasn't, and I fell into the first of many realms thinking: at least I fed the dog first. At least there's that.
