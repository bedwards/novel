# Prologue - Page 1

I fed the dog first—that's how they got me. Everyone remembers that part, the kindness that preceded the rest, as if charity could inoculate against what came after. The dog was three-legged, shivering in the alley behind Kepler's Bar where I'd stopped to piss at 2 AM, and I gave it half a sandwich I'd been saving. My father would have called this weakness. He'd been dead six months and I could still hear him. Soft, he would have said. Always so fucking soft.

When Mara appeared from the bar's back door with two men I didn't recognize, she was wearing a dress I thought I remembered from years ago, from when we were seventeen maybe, or sixteen—some summer night in her mother's garden shed, mosquitoes against the screens and her skin smelling like the jasmine that grew wild along the fence. Before I understood she was already planning to leave. Before I understood anything. She said it exactly the way my father would have: "Soft. Always so fucking soft." The taller man behind her had a gun and the shorter one was holding my wallet, which I'd left on the bar while helping that dog, and this was stupidity, not nobility, though I'd drunk enough to find the distinction meaningless.

"Kill him," the taller man said to Mara, not asking, testing something, and she shot the dog instead. One clean pop. The animal didn't even yelp, just folded into itself like bad origami or like how paper cranes collapse when you don't crease them right. I thought: this is how I'll remember her, not the garden shed or the promises she'd made about Paris—had she promised Paris? Or had I invented that later?—but this. Her choosing the easy cruelty over the hard one. She'd always been steady like that, even when we were children, which might have been when she first explained that love was a transaction, some afternoon in summer, or maybe I'm conflating different afternoons, different summers. She'd been steady and I'd believed her because I was fifteen or sixteen and stupid.

The taller man grabbed my shoulder and his hand was changing. I saw this clearly even drunk—the fingers lengthening, nails darkening to claws, the whole shape of it shifting like meat does when it spoils in time-lapse. He was halfway between what he'd been and what he was becoming. Not metaphor. I'd heard stories about the Converted, people who'd crossed over and come back altered, but I'd assumed they were stories in the way you assume anything sufficiently strange is a story until it's standing in front of you with its hand on your shoulder turning into something with claws.

"The professor said you'd know where it is," the shorter man said, meaning Dr. Zheng, my mentor, who'd called me three days earlier—or maybe it was four days, the week had that blurred quality of weeks where you're drinking too much and sleeping too little—to say he was sorry, that he'd given them my name when they'd started breaking his fingers. Betrayal is just the friend you haven't met yet, my father used to say. He was good at aphorisms, less good at staying sober, though I'm not one to judge on that particular count.

I said I didn't know what they were talking about, which was true in the sense that I didn't know what they wanted, false in that I knew I'd give it to them anyway. Cowardice or pragmatism—another distinction without meaning.

Mara pressed the gun against my temple. "Your father left you something. The key to the Third Realm." Her hand was steady. It had always been steady. I remembered Zheng mentioning the Third Realm once at a faculty dinner, drunk, saying it like a joke, and we'd all laughed because that's what you do when someone says something ridiculous at a faculty dinner, you laugh and pour more wine and change the subject. Or maybe it wasn't Zheng who mentioned it. Maybe it was someone else and I'm remembering it wrong, the way you remember things wrong when you're trying to make sense of them later.

"That's not real," I said.

The taller man's transformation completed while I was saying this. He was dog now, or dog-shaped, teeth like porcelain knives, and the three-legged corpse at my feet had been his practice run, his becoming. He looked at me with something like pity and said, "Nothing's real until it eats you," his voice already sliding into growl, already losing the consonants.

Mara pulled the trigger. I heard the click, then nothing. The gun jammed, or she'd never loaded it, or this was all another test in a series of tests that began when I fed that fucking dog and would end—I could see it now, see the shape of what was coming the way you can see the shape of a story when you're three-quarters drunk and someone's holding a gun to your head—with me descending through realities I hadn't believed in until thirty seconds ago, hunting for something my father had hidden because he knew I'd be fool enough to look.

She lowered the gun. She was right. She'd always been right. That was the problem.

"The dog was the B-plot," I said, understanding.

"The dog is always the B-plot," the man who'd been Viktor said, his muzzle already pushing through his face. "Now we drop."

The alley floor opened beneath us, which should have been impossible but wasn't, and I fell into the first of many realms thinking: at least I fed the dog first. At least there's that.
