# Prologue - Page 1

I fed the dog first—that's how they got me. Everyone remembers that part, the kindness that preceded the rest, as if charity could inoculate against what came after. The dog was three-legged, shivering in the alley behind Kepler's Bar where I'd stopped to piss at 2 AM, and I gave it half a sandwich I'd been saving. My father would have called this weakness. He'd been dead six months and I could still hear him. Soft, he would have said. Always so fucking soft.

When Mara appeared from the bar's back door with two men I didn't recognize, she was wearing a dress I thought I remembered from years ago, from when we were seventeen, some summer night in her mother's garden shed, mosquitoes against the screens and her skin smelling like the jasmine that grew wild along the fence. Before I understood she was already planning to leave. Before I understood anything. She said it exactly the way my father would have: "Soft. Always so fucking soft." The taller man behind her had a gun and the shorter one was holding my wallet, which I'd left on the bar while helping that dog, and this was stupidity, not nobility, though I'd drunk enough to find the distinction meaningless.

"Kill him," the taller man said to Mara. Not asking. Testing. She turned and shot the dog instead—not me, the dog—one clean pop. The animal didn't even yelp, just folded into itself like bad origami or like how paper cranes collapse when you don't crease them right. I thought: this is how I'll remember her, not the garden shed or the promises about Paris, but this. Her choosing the easy cruelty over the hard one. She'd always been steady like that, even when we were children, when she first explained that love was a transaction. She'd been steady and I'd believed her because I was fifteen and stupid.

The taller man grabbed my shoulder and his hand was changing. I saw this clearly even drunk—the fingers lengthening, nails darkening to claws, the whole shape of it shifting like meat does when it spoils in time-lapse. He was halfway between what he'd been and what he was becoming. Not metaphor. I'd heard stories about the Converted, people who'd crossed over and come back altered, but I'd assumed they were stories in the way you assume anything sufficiently strange is a story until it's standing in front of you with its hand on your shoulder turning into something with claws.

"The professor said you'd know where it is," the shorter man said, meaning Dr. Zheng, my mentor, who'd called me three days earlier to say he was sorry, that he'd given them my name when they'd started breaking Zheng's fingers. His own fingers. He'd apologized for giving me up while they were breaking his hands.

I said I didn't know what they were talking about, which was true in the sense that I didn't know what they wanted, false in that I knew I'd give it to them anyway. Cowardice or pragmatism—another distinction without meaning.

Mara pressed the gun against my temple. "Your father left you something." Her hand was steady. It had always been steady. I remembered—no, I was back there suddenly, at the faculty dinner, Zheng drunk and expansive in that way he got after his third glass of wine, the restaurant was Italian, red and white checkered tablecloths and someone's wife whose name I've forgotten laughing too loud at someone else's joke. Zheng leaning across the table, nearly knocking over the wine, saying there were other places, nested one inside the other like Russian dolls, and you could go down if you knew the way, if you had the right key or the right words or the right state of mind—he wasn't clear on that part, he kept changing the terms—and someone made a joke about Narnia and someone else said something about Dante and we all laughed because that's what you do when a drunk professor starts talking about metaphysics and alternate realities, you laugh and pour more wine. But Zheng wasn't laughing. He said his grandfather had crossed over once, had come back altered, wouldn't talk about what he'd seen except to say that the world we thought was solid was just the surface, and beneath it—

Mara's voice pulled me back: "The key your father left. You know what I'm talking about."

"That's not real," I said, but I was thinking about Zheng's face that night, how serious he'd been under the wine.

The taller man's transformation completed while I was saying this. He was dog now, or dog-shaped, teeth like porcelain knives, and the three-legged corpse at my feet had been his practice run, his becoming. He looked at me with something like pity and said, "Nothing's real until it eats you," his voice already sliding into growl, already losing the consonants.

Mara pulled the trigger. I heard the click, then nothing. The gun jammed, or she'd never loaded it, or this was all another test in a series of tests that began when I fed that fucking dog and would end—I could see it now—with me descending through realities I hadn't believed in until thirty seconds ago, hunting for something my father had hidden because he knew I'd be fool enough to look.

She lowered the gun. She was right. She'd always been right. That was the problem.

I looked at the dog's body at my feet. I'd fed it first. That had to count for something.

"Now we drop," the man said, his muzzle already pushing through his face.

The alley floor opened beneath us, which should have been impossible but wasn't, and I fell into the first of many realms.
