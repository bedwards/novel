# Chapter One

We'd been tracking them for two days, hanging back just beyond the horizon, watching their sails. The *Petrel* out of Nantucket, Captain Silas Worth commanding, though I wouldn't learn his name until later, until after everything had happened and there was time to go through what was left.

On the morning of the third day they harpooned something.

I was in the rigging when it surfaced—not because I was skilled at rigging work but because someone had to do it and I was competent enough not to fall—and even from that height you could tell the whale was enormous. The kind that makes you understand why sailors used to think there were sea monsters. The men in the small boats went after it with harpoons and the whale dove, and when it surfaced again it was bleeding, and when it dove a second time one of the boats went with it, pulled under by the line, and came up twenty seconds later without three of its crew.

This went on for six hours. We closed the distance slowly, like we were just another ship passing through, no threat, nothing to worry about. Captain Edward Fitch—my captain—stood at the rail with his spectacles on, watching the whole thing with the same expression he used when reviewing manifests. He was an accountant's son from Manchester who'd gotten into piracy because he was good with numbers and better at violence, though he kept the violence efficient, practical, like he was solving equations. No speeches. No grand gestures. Just: this is what needs to happen, and then it happened.

By the time we were close enough to see details, the whale was still alive, barely, attached to the side of the *Petrel* with maybe a dozen harpoons in its flesh. The water around the ship had turned that particular shade of red you only see in certain contexts, dark and thick like someone had poured dye into the ocean. The crew was repelling down the side of the hull with long cutting blades—flensing knives, I learned later—hacking at the whale while it was still breathing, stripping the blubber in long spirals that they hauled up onto the deck with block and tackle.

The work was methodical. That's what struck me. Not frenzied or cruel, just methodical, like butchers working on a carcass, except the carcass was still making sounds. Low sounds. Like moaning. Like something trying to speak but not having the right mouth for it.

The crew of the *Petrel* was unlike any I'd seen. Portuguese, Polynesian, African, Irish, maybe a dozen nationalities I couldn't even name, all of them speaking a simplified language that was more gesture and grunt than actual words—a ship-pidgin that had evolved to communicate the essentials: pull, tie, move, watch, whale. Our crew could barely understand it, but we didn't need to understand. We knew what we were there for.

Fitch raised his hand. Someone—Davies, I think—fired the first cannon. Not at the ship, at the water just off their bow. A warning shot, though not much of a warning. The *Petrel*'s crew didn't even look up. They kept working, faster now, hauling blubber. They'd seen our colors, the black flag with the white hand that was supposed to be menacing but mostly looked like something a child would draw. They knew what we were. They just didn't care. The whale oil was worth more than their lives and they were getting as much of it as they could before we took it from them.

The second cannon hit their rigging. Ropes snapped. A spar came down. Still they kept cutting.

We threw grapples. The hooks caught. Our crew pulled the ships together and started boarding, cutlasses drawn, pistols loaded, the usual theater of violence that's supposed to make people surrender without actually having to kill everyone. But the *Petrel*'s crew barely acknowledged us. A few of them grabbed marlinspikes or gutting knives and fought back, but most of them just kept working on the whale, like if they could get enough blubber aboard it would somehow matter, like the oil was more important than breathing.

I went over with the second wave. That's when I saw the whale's eye up close. Dinner-plate sized. Looking at me—not looking in my direction but at me specifically—and I understood something in that moment that I still don't have words for. It knew what was happening. It knew what we were. And it had opinions about both.

Fitch shot the first man who came at him, a huge Polynesian with a flensing knife who moved like he'd done this before. The man went down and didn't get back up. Fitch reloaded, shot another man, reloaded again. Efficient. Methodical. Like he was balancing accounts.

The work was drab and my hands were always bleeding. Not from violence—though there was plenty of that—but from the ropes, the salt, the endless scraping and hauling and tying that makes up most of what happens on a ship. People who've never been to sea think it's all adventure and treasure, but mostly it's bleeding hands and the smell of tar and trying not to fall overboard when the deck pitches in a storm. I was competent at it. Not the best, not the worst. Middling. That was the word Fitch used when he bothered to use words at all, which wasn't often.

But this wasn't drab work. This was the other thing, the violence that funded the drab work, and I'd gotten good at it in the way you get good at anything you do often enough. I had a cutlass and a pistol and I used both on two of the *Petrel*'s crew who came at me with knives, and they went down the way people go down when you shoot them or cut them, which is never as dramatic as you'd think. Just down. Just stopped.

Our crew was taking casualties too. One of ours—a man named Thomas whose last name I never learned—got gutted by a harpoon, the kind meant for whales not men, and it went through him like he wasn't even there. He tried to hold his insides in with his hands and couldn't and fell over the side into that red water.

Still the *Petrel*'s crew kept cutting the whale.

Captain Worth—I saw him now for the first time, an old man with bark-hands and a face like weathered leather—was standing at the rail with a harpoon in his hands. Not fighting. Just standing there. Watching his crew work. Watching us kill them. And when Fitch walked up to him, pistol aimed at his chest, Worth didn't say anything. He just took the harpoon in both hands, positioned the point against his own sternum, and drove it forward hard enough that it went through him and into the whale's flesh behind him, pinning himself to the dying animal like he was making some kind of point about something, though what that point was I couldn't have said then and still can't say now.

He died looking at the whale's eye, which was still looking at me.

The killing went on for maybe twenty minutes. Not a battle—there wasn't enough resistance for that—just murder, which is what it was, and looting, which is what followed. We took what we could carry: the blubber they'd already cut, some of their tools, whatever personal items seemed valuable. Fitch went through the captain's cabin and came out with a strongbox and a ledger, which he flipped through with the same expression he always had, like he was confirming numbers.

The whale died while we were looting. I didn't see it happen but I felt it somehow, or maybe I just noticed that the sounds stopped, those low moaning sounds, and there was just the sound of men shouting and cargo being moved and the creak of wood and rope.

We left the *Petrel* drifting with her dead. Standard practice. Let the ocean take them. It always did.

On the voyage back Fitch calculated our shares, wrote them in his ledger with his pencil stub, and told us what we'd made. It wasn't much. Whale oil wasn't what we usually went after and we'd taken casualties. Thomas was dead, another man had lost fingers, a third had taken a knife to the gut and might or might not survive the week. For whale oil. For street lamps in cities we'd never see. For light so that polished people could walk safely through polished streets and never think about what burned to make that light possible.

I thought about that a lot. Still do.
