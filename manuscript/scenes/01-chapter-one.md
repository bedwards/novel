# Chapter One

The work was drab and my hands were always bleeding. Not from violence—though there was plenty of that—but from the ropes, the salt, the endless scraping and hauling and tying that makes up most of what happens on a ship. People who've never been to sea think it's all adventure and treasure and freedom, but mostly it's bleeding hands and the smell of tar and trying not to fall overboard when the deck pitches in a storm. I was competent at it. Not the best, not the worst. Middling. That was the word the captain used when he bothered to use words at all, which wasn't often.

The captain wasn't what you'd expect. No peg leg, no parrot, no grand speeches about the sea. He was an accountant's son from Manchester who'd gotten into the business because he was good with numbers and better with violence, though he kept the violence efficient, almost boring in its execution. He wore spectacles. He read books. When we took a ship he'd go through the manifest with the same expression someone might use reviewing a grocery list, marking items with a pencil stub he kept in his vest pocket. The crew found this disconcerting. I found it restful. You always knew where you stood with the captain, which was somewhere between useful and disposable, and as long as you stayed useful he'd let you keep breathing.

We'd been following the whaler for two days. The *Petrel*, out of Nantucket, her hull dark with tar and her crew a mix I'd never seen before—Portuguese, Polynesian, African, Irish, maybe a dozen nationalities I couldn't even name, all of them speaking a simplified ship-language that was more gesture and grunt than actual words, a pidgin that had evolved to communicate the essentials: pull, tie, move, watch, whale. Our crew could barely understand them when we got close enough to listen, which we did on the second night, hanging back just beyond the horizon and watching their lights.

On the morning of the third day they harpooned something.

I was in the rigging when it happened, tying off a line that had come loose in the night, and I saw the whole thing from above. The whale surfaced maybe two hundred yards from their ship, and even from that distance you could tell it was enormous, the kind of sperm whale that makes you understand why people used to think there were sea monsters. The men in the small boats—they called them whaleboats, I learned later—went after it with harpoons, and the whale dove, and when it surfaced again it was bleeding, and when it dove a second time one of the boats went with it, pulled under by the line, and came up twenty seconds later without three of its crew.

This went on for six hours.

By the time we closed the distance the whale was still alive, barely, attached to the side of the *Petrel* with maybe a dozen harpoons in its flesh, the water around the ship so red it looked like someone had dumped dye into the ocean. The crew was repelling down the side of the hull with long cutting blades, hacking at the whale while it was still breathing, stripping the blubber in long spirals that they hauled up onto the deck with block and tackle. The whale made sounds. I hadn't expected that. Low sounds, like moaning, like something trying to speak but not having the right mouth for it.

Our captain stood at the rail watching this with his spectacles on, making those same calculations he always made, probably determining whether it was worth attacking a whaling crew that had just spent six hours killing something that size, whether they'd have any fight left in them, whether the whale blubber was worth the risk. He decided it was.

"Raise colors," he said to no one in particular, and someone—I think it was Davies—ran up our flag, which was black with a white hand on it, nothing poetic, just a hand, palm out, like someone saying stop. It was supposed to be menacing but mostly looked like something a child would draw.

The crew of the *Petrel* saw the flag and understood what it meant, but they didn't stop cutting the whale. They kept working, faster now, hauling blubber, and I realized they were trying to get as much value out of it as they could before we took it from them, that they'd already accepted we were taking it, they were just negotiating with time and physics about how much they could keep.

We pulled alongside and threw grapples. The captain went over first, which he always did, no dramatic speech or drawn cutlass, just stepped over the rail and onto their deck like he was crossing a street, and the rest of us followed because that's what you did. Their captain—an old man with hands like tree bark and no expression at all on his face—stood there with a marlinspike in his belt and waited for our captain to say something.

Our captain said: "You'll give us half."

Their captain looked at the whale, then at his crew, then back at our captain. He said something in that ship-pidgin that I didn't understand but the tone was clear: negotiation. Our captain pulled out his ledger and a pencil and started calculating, right there on a blood-soaked deck with a dying whale hanging off the side of the ship, actually doing the math about tonnage and value and crew shares, and after maybe two minutes of this he looked up and said: "Forty percent."

Their captain nodded. Just like that. No fight. No drama. Just two men agreeing on numbers while the whale moaned.

I looked at the whale. Its eye was the size of a dinner plate and it was looking at me—not looking in my direction, looking at me specifically—and I understood something in that moment that I can't quite explain except to say that it knew what was happening and it knew what we were and it had opinions about both, and those opinions were not favorable.

That's when things went wrong.
