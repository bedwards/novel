# Scene 1: Routine

The lens housing needed cleaning again.

Elena climbed the spiral stairs with her bucket and rags, counting steps out of habit rather than need. One hundred and three. The number never changed, but her body kept track anyway, the rhythm of ascent as familiar as breathing.

At the gallery deck, wind hit her face. November wind, the kind that found every gap in her jacket and reminded her that winter was coming whether she was ready or not. She wasn't. Three years at Widow's Point and she still hadn't learned to be ready.

The beacon caught the late afternoon sun, its lens throwing fractured light across the water. Elena set down her bucket and pulled on her work gloves. Salt spray had crusted the housing again, dimming the output by at least fifteen percent. Not enough to trigger the sensors, but enough that she'd notice. She always noticed.

She worked methodically, wiping away the accumulated salt in smooth circles. Below, the ocean moved in its eternal rhythm against the rocks. The mainland was a smudge of trees and buildings to the west, close enough to see, far enough to ignore.

Her radio crackled.

"Widow's Point, this is Harbormaster. Weekly check. How copy?"

Elena pulled the radio from her belt. "Copy clear. All systems normal."

"Weather service says storm tonight. Big one."

She glanced at the horizon. The sky was already the wrong color, gray-green and heavy. "I saw."

"You good for supplies? We could run out tomorrow if you need anything."

"I'm good."

A pause. She could almost hear Tom wrestling with whether to say more, to push past her terse responses into something resembling conversation. After three years, he still tried sometimes.

"All right then. Stay safe out there."

"Always do."

She hooked the radio back on her belt and returned to the lens. The gulls were getting louder, their calls sharp with the same weather sense that had turned the sky that particular shade of threat. They'd find shelter. They always did.

Elena finished the housing and moved to the gallery railing, checking for loose bolts. Everything secure. Everything always secure. That was her job: maintain the lighthouse, keep the light burning, make sure the tower stood against whatever the ocean threw at it.

She'd been good at it for three years. Good at maintenance, good at solitude, good at not thinking about why she'd come here in the first place.

The storm was moving in fast now. She could smell it on the wind, that particular metallic scent that came before heavy weather. She should finish her rounds, secure the shutters, make sure everything was battened down.

Instead, she stayed at the railing, watching the water darken.

Dylan had liked storms. He used to sit at their mother's kitchen window and watch the rain, making up stories about where the clouds had been, what they'd seen. She'd been the practical one, checking the windows were locked, finding flashlights, making sure they were prepared.

She was still the practical one. Dylan was—

Elena pushed away from the railing and grabbed her bucket. The stairs waited. One hundred and three of them, heading down.

She didn't count this time.
