# Writing Style Guide - The Last Lighthouse

## Voice and Tone
Literary mystery with atmospheric, contemplative prose. Serious but not heavy. Precise language that evokes mood without purple prose. The story earns its metaphors through the lighthouse/maritime setting.

## POV Guidelines
- **POV Type**: Third Person Limited
- **POV Character(s)**: Primarily Elena; possibly Captain Archer via journal entries (first person)
- **POV Rules**:
  - Stay deep in Elena's perspective for present timeline
  - Filter all description through her observations and knowledge
  - Journal entries can be first person (Archer's voice)
  - No head-hopping within scenes
  - Scene breaks if switching perspective

## Stylistic Preferences

### Sentence Structure
- Varied rhythm: mix short and long sentences
- Short for tension/clarity: "The light went out."
- Long for contemplation: "She had always known, somewhere beneath the daily routines and maintenance logs, that the lighthouse kept its secrets as carefully as she kept hers."
- Avoid excessive fragmentation
- Maritime/atmospheric metaphors are natural to setting but use sparingly

### Dialogue Style
- Elena: Direct, minimal, honest
- Others: Varies by character
- Minimal dialogue tags when possible
- Subtext important—people don't always say what they mean
- Not overly formal but not sloppy
- Regional flavor (Maine coast) subtle, not heavy

### Description Density
- Moderate to dense for atmosphere
- Lighter during action/tension
- Sensory details important (fog, salt, wind, stone)
- Through character lens: Elena notices structural things, patterns, maritime details
- Avoid grocery lists: select telling details

### Pacing Preferences
- Deliberate, building tension through accumulation
- Not rushed—let scenes breathe
- Faster pacing during active investigation
- Slower during contemplation, journal reading
- Mystery unfolds gradually
- Comfortable with quiet moments

## Words to Avoid
- Marcus (reserved placeholder)
- Chen (reserved placeholder)
- Overused mystery clichés: "little did she know," "if only she had known"
- Filter words (saw, felt, heard) except when deliberate
- Very, really, quite (use stronger words instead)

## Vocabulary Register
- Educated but accessible
- Maritime terminology used naturally (Elena's background)
- Scientific terms where appropriate (her training)
- Literary but not pretentious
- Concrete nouns, strong verbs

## Genre Conventions to Follow
- Mystery: Plant clues, foreshadow, build suspense
- Literary: Character depth, thematic resonance, prose quality
- Atmospheric: Setting as character, mood maintenance
- Fair play: Reader can theoretically solve mystery

## Genre Conventions to Subvert
- Not a cozy mystery (stakes are real, dark)
- Not thriller-paced (more contemplative)
- Ambiguity is okay (not everything needs neat resolution)
- Supernatural elements may or may not be real

## Specific Stylistic Notes

### The Lighthouse as Metaphor
- Available but don't overuse
- Elena as keeper/warning light/isolated
- Journal as hidden history
- Let readers make connections

### Time Periods
- **Present (Elena's timeline)**: Past tense, third limited
- **1891 (Journal)**: Could be present tense, first person for immediacy
- **Flashbacks (Dylan)**: Past tense, stay in Elena's memory POV

### Weather and Atmosphere
- Important but not constant
- Weather affects mood and plot
- Fog particularly significant
- Don't start every chapter with weather report

### The Mystery Elements
- Information revealed gradually
- Some red herrings but fair play
- Clues in journal entries
- Elena's investigation should feel real (research, deduction, dead ends)

### Emotional Truth
- Elena's grief is quiet, persistent, daily
- Not melodramatic
- Isolation effects should feel real
- Her questioning her sanity should be believable

## Examples of Desired Style

**Good**:
> The storm had torn three shingles from the gallery deck and cracked the lens housing. Elena found the damage at dawn, after a night of listening to the tower strain against wind that seemed determined to push it into the sea.

**Too Purple**:
> The tempest had ravaged the lighthouse like a vengeful spirit, its furious fingers tearing at the ancient structure as the tower groaned in agony beneath the onslaught of nature's wrath.

**Too Sparse**:
> The storm damaged the lighthouse. Elena saw it in the morning. It was bad.

## Writing Process Notes
- First draft can be messier—discovery writing okay
- Second draft for rhythm and precision
- Read dialogue aloud
- Every scene should advance plot OR character OR atmosphere (preferably multiple)
- Trust the reader
- Less is more with emotional moments
- Earn the big moments through accumulation
