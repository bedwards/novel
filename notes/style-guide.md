# Writing Style Guide

## Voice and Tone
Observant, precise, understated. Philosophical but not pretentious. Pragmatic truths revealed through simple, direct action. First person narrator who watches more than explains.

## POV Guidelines
- **POV Type**: First Person
- **POV Character(s)**: Changes between chapters but stable within
- **POV Rules**:
  - Stay in one character's POV per chapter
  - Narrator is observant, not chatty
  - Only access to narrator's internals
  - When dropping into frame stories: first person narration
  - Filter everything through narrator's observations

## Stylistic Preferences

### Sentence Structure
- Varied rhythm based on author's samples
- Precise, careful observations
- Mix of short declarative and longer contemplative
- Not flowery, not spare - balanced
- From samples: "She was too obliging." / "The yellow light seeped out into the grey as if filling an invisible bowl"

### Dialogue Style
- Direct
- Reveals character through what's said and what isn't
- Minimal dialogue tags when clear who's speaking
- Subtext important
- Characters lie, deceive, plot
- Varying intelligence levels between characters

### Description Density
- Moderate
- Through narrator's lens (what they notice)
- Sensory but not excessive
- Select telling details
- Character traits shown through action/speech, not narrator description

### Pacing Preferences
- Deliberate
- First page: deliberately FAST (cramming everything in)
- After first page: philosophical, measured
- Let scenes breathe
- Trust the reader

## Words to Avoid
- Marcus (forbidden placeholder)
- Chen (forbidden placeholder)
- Overexplaining
- Cheap mystery tricks/delays of information
- Generic AI writing

## Vocabulary Register
- Educated, observant
- Not pretentious
- Concrete, specific
- Strong verbs, precise nouns

## Philosophical Approach
- Truths exposed through simplified scenes
- Pragmatic, not academic
- Show through action, not lengthy explanation
- Let reader make connections

## Genre Conventions to Follow
- Literary fiction quality
- Philosophical depth through action
- Frame narrative structure (GEB-inspired)

## Genre Conventions to Subvert
- No burying the lede
- Reveal information when it's time
- No withholding for cheap suspense
- First page deliberately over-the-top to clear space

## Specific Stylistic Notes

### Frame Story Drops
- When character drops into new reality: shift to first person narration
- Clear transition moments
- Each level has its own internal logic
- Don't overuse - let it develop organically

### Character Complexity
- Rational AND irrational in same character
- Vices present
- Varying intelligence levels
- Coen Brothers-style plotting (stupidity, deception, chaos)
- Some characters smarter than others

### Unreliable Narrator
- First person narrator may not be trustworthy
- Let reader discover this through inconsistencies
- Don't telegraph it

### The First Page Exception
First page ONLY: deliberately cram in everything to get it out of the way
- Sex, murder, hero's journey, B-plot, villain, etc.
- This is intentionally exaggerated
- Clears space for philosophical work in rest of novel

## Writing Process Notes
- Dean Koontz method: perfect one page before moving to next
- Hammer each page back and forth with author
- Don't move forward until current page is perfect
- Quality over speed
- Each page stands alone as complete

## Reference Influences
- Kurt Vonnegut (don't bury the lede)
- Coen Brothers (Miller's Crossing - plotting, character intelligence variance)
- Gödel, Escher, Bach (frame structures)
- Dean Koontz (process, not style)
- Author's samples (voice, rhythm, observation)
