# Dog-Man / Pirate Narrator

## Basic Information
- **Full Name**: [Not revealed in Ch1]
- **Age**: [Unknown - appears adult]
- **Role**: Antagonist in Prologue / Protagonist-Narrator in Chapter 1
- **First Appearance**: Prologue (as transforming tall man), Chapter 1 (as narrator)

## Dual Nature

### In Prologue (Converted Form)
- Tall man with gun
- Transforms into dog-shaped creature: claws, teeth like porcelain knives, muzzle
- Voice slides into growl but remains comprehensible
- One of "the Converted" - crossed over and came back altered
- Working with Mara and shorter man to get narrator's father's key
- Obsessed with modern LED street lamps
- Freezes under lamp post, scratches metal post with claws
- Launches into story of whaling ship unprompted

### In Chapter 1 (Human Pirate, Early 1800s)
- Competent, middling pirate on Captain Fitch's ship
- "Not the best, not the worst. Middling."
- Does rigging work (not skilled, just competent enough)
- Good at violence in practical way (cutlass, pistol)
- Observant, detailed narrator

## Personality
- **Fixated on purpose**: Obsesses over why whale dies (for street lamps, for polished society)
- **Observant**: Notes details others miss (whale's eye, ship-pidgin, methodical work)
- **Practical**: Describes violence plainly, without romance or drama
- **Reflective**: "I thought about that a lot. Still do."
- **Competent but not exceptional**: Comfortable with his middling status

## Voice as Narrator (Chapter 1)
- First person, past tense
- Precise, measured observations
- No flowery language - direct, concrete
- Interrupts present action with background (sprinkles mundane details throughout)
- Philosophical undertones without explicit philosophy
- Details violence matter-of-factly: "Just down. Just stopped."
- Returns to fixation: purpose of the oil, the lamps, the polished streets

## Physical Details (Chapter 1)
- Hands always bleeding (ropes, salt, tar)
- Works in rigging, hauls cargo, ties knots
- Uses cutlass and pistol competently
- Strong enough for pirate work, not remarkably so

## Relationships (Chapter 1)
- **Captain Fitch**: Boss, calls him "middling," uses words sparingly
- **Thomas**: Fellow pirate, gutted by harpoon, falls into red water
- **Davies**: Fires first cannon
- **The whale**: Its dinner-plate eye looks at narrator specifically
- **Captain Worth**: Whaling captain who leaps onto whale, impales self

## Key Moments
**Prologue**: 
- Transformation complete as three-legged dog dies
- Looks at narrator with "something like pity"
- "Nothing's real until it eats you"
- Fixates on street lamps, can't be moved
- Begins telling story

**Chapter 1**:
- Watches six-hour whale hunt from rigging
- Sees whale's eye looking at him: "It knew what was happening. It knew what we were. And it had opinions about both."
- Kills two whalers matter-of-factly
- Watches Thomas die, Worth suicide
- Reflects on purpose: whale oil for street lamps, polished people, distant cities

## Central Obsession
The purpose of violence and death - specifically, that enormous suffering (whale's death, crew murders) serves distant, mundane purposes (lighting city streets). Fixates on this connection across time/reality (street lamps in modern prologue, whale oil in 1800s chapter).

## The Whale's Eye
Recurring image: whale's dinner-plate eye looking at narrator specifically. Narrator understands something wordless in that moment. Worth dies looking at whale's eye "which was still looking at me." Connection between narrator and whale - witness and witnessed.

## Connection to Frame Structure
Dog-man in prologue is somehow the pirate in Chapter 1. No explanation given. Time is fluid. Transformation/crossing-over connects the realities. His story about the *Petrel* IS Chapter 1 - we enter it as he tells it, become him in that reality.

## Notes for Writing
- Keep his voice plain, direct, observant
- Don't romanticize the violence - describe it like work
- Return to the lamp/oil/purpose fixation periodically
- Let philosophy emerge through observation, never state it
- He notices what others don't (eye, sounds, purposes)
- Competent at violence without being proud of it
- The whale matters to him in ways he can't fully articulate
