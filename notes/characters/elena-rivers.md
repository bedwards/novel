- Curious despite her efforts to suppress it
- Honest to the point of bluntness

## Motivation
- **Surface**: Maintain the lighthouse, avoid painful memories
- **Deep**: Find Dylan, understand what happened
- **Fear**: That she'll discover Dylan chose to leave her

## Internal Conflict
- Wants isolation but is lonely
- Trained to trust evidence but drawn to mystery
- Needs closure but fears what she'll find
- Believes she's protecting herself through isolation, actually imprisoning herself

## Arc
- **Beginning**: Isolated, avoiding life and pain
- **Middle**: Forced to engage, investigate, risk
- **End**: Chooses connection, accepts loss, moves forward

## Voice
- Internal monologue: Precise, slightly sardonic
- Speech: Direct, minimal small talk

## Notes for Writing
- POV: Third person limited (deep in her perspective)

- Her isolation is both shield and cage
- Don't make her melodramatic—grief is quiet, daily, persistent
