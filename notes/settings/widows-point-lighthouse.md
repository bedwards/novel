# Widow's Point Lighthouse

## Overview
An automated lighthouse on a rocky outcrop off the Maine coast, operational since 1889. Now requires only a single keeper for maintenance and emergency operations.

## Physical Details

### The Tower
- 67 feet tall, white stone construction
- Spiral iron staircase, 103 steps
- Automated beacon at top (Elena maintains but doesn't operate)
- Stone walls 3 feet thick at base
- Windows at regular intervals, narrow to withstand storms
- Hidden compartment discovered in Chapter 3 (between floors 4-5)

### The Keeper's House
- Attached to tower base
- Two rooms: main living space, small bedroom
- Kitchen efficient but dated (1970s updates)
- Woodstove for heat, electric backup
- Large windows facing mainland, shuttered against storms
- Elena has made it functional but not homey

### The Grounds
- Rocky outcrop, approximately 1 acre at high tide
- Small boathouse at landing dock
- Oil storage (no longer used, historical)
- Elena's garden attempt (mostly failed, too exposed)
- Path from dock to lighthouse worn smooth

### Access
- 15-minute boat ride from nearest mainland dock
- Impassable in bad weather
- Supply deliveries every two weeks
- Coast Guard checks quarterly

## Sensory Details

### Sight
- White tower against gray sea and sky
- Beacon sweep at night
- Seabirds constant
- Fog that comes without warning
- Rocky shore, dark water

### Sound
- Waves against rocks (constant bass note)
- Wind around tower (moaning through windows)
- Seabirds' cries
- Beacon mechanism (quiet hum, mechanical precision)
- Fog horn (automated, rare now)

### Smell
- Salt air always
- Diesel from backup generator
- Wood smoke from stove in winter
- Seaweed at low tide
- Damp stone inside tower

### Touch
- Always windy (hair in face, clothes tugged)
- Temperature drops near water
- Stone walls cold even in summer
- Iron staircase smooth from generations of hands

### Taste
- Salt on lips from spray
- Strong coffee (Elena's constant companion)

## Significance
- Elena's refuge and prison
- Symbolic: isolated, warning others away
- Location for discovery (hidden journal)
- Vantage point for mysterious lights/ships
- Family connection: Dylan visited here before vanishing

## Historical Notes
- Built 1889 after series of shipwrecks
- Named for Captain's widow who funded construction
- Automated 1976
- 7 keepers before Elena (two died, two vanished, three retired)
- Always understaffed—difficult posting

## Scenes Set Here
- Chapter 1: Opening, establishing routine
- Chapter 2: Storm and damage
- Chapter 3: Discovery of journal
- [More to be added as story develops]

## Atmosphere Notes
- Isolation but not peaceful—active, demanding
- Weather is a character
- Age and history everywhere
- Should feel both protective and confining
- Beautiful but severe
