# Project Overview

## Novel Information
- **Title**: [TBD]
- **Genre**: Philosophical Fiction / Literary Fiction
- **Target Word Count**: 80,000+
- **POV**: First Person (stable within chapters, changes between chapters)
- **Tense**: Past
- **Process**: Dean Koontz method - perfect one page at a time before moving forward

## Core Concept
Highly philosophical but pragmatic. Simplified scenes stripped down to expose truths. Multiple levels of nested frame stories (Gödel, Escher, Bach-inspired). Frame narrative where stories drop into lower realities told in first person.

## Key Structural Elements

### Frame Story Structure
- **Prologue**: Top-level frame - unnamed narrator forced by Mara, dog-man (Converted), and shorter man to retrieve father's key. Dog-man fixates on street lamps, begins telling story of whaling ship attack.
- **Body**: Dog-man's story becomes Chapter 1 (early 1800s pirate ship attacking whaling vessel). Multiple nested frames to follow. Each level first person.
- **Epilogue**: Return to prologue's top-level frame
- GEB-inspired recursive structure, organic not forced

### POV Rules
- First person narrator (primary)
- Narrator stable within each chapter
- Changes between chapters
- Only access to ONE person's internals at a time
- When dropping into new frame = new first person narrator
- Narrators are observant, not chatty

### Actual Opening Content (Prologue)
- Narrator feeds three-legged dog (save-the-cat moment)
- Mara appears with two men (one tall/transforming, one short)
- Tall man hands gun to Mara, commands "Knee-cap him"
- Mara shoots dog instead (testing/cruelty)
- Dog-man (tall man) transforms into dog-shaped Converted
- They march narrator to retrieve father's key (brass key on leather cord)
- Extended memory drop: faculty dinner at Paradiso, Dr. Zheng tells story of grandfather crossing over to nested worlds
- Street lamp fixation triggers dog-man's memory of whaling ship
- Dog-man begins telling story → Chapter 1

### Chapter 1 Content
- First person narrator is now the dog-man (pirate)
- Early 1800s pirate ship tracking whaling vessel *Petrel*
- Captain Edward Fitch: accountant's son, spectacles, ledger, efficient violence
- Six-hour whale hunt witnessed, whale still alive while being butchered
- Multi-cultural whaling crew speaking ship-pidgin
- Pirates attack, whalers keep working obsessively
- No negotiation - murder and domination for no meaningful purpose
- Captain Silas Worth leaps onto dying whale, impales himself with harpoon
- Pirate casualties (Thomas gutted, others wounded)
- Poor haul, not worth it, but they took it anyway
- Narrator obsessed with purpose: whale oil for city street lamps, polished society

### Writing Principles
- **Don't bury the lede** (Kurt Vonnegut) - reveal immediately, no cheap tricks
- **Show through action** - character traits through actions/words, not descriptions
- **Miller's Crossing influence** - plotting, intelligence variance, rational/irrational contrast, vices
- **Pragmatic philosophy** - truths through simple, direct scenes
- **Long paragraphs** - vary length, embed dialogue, stream of consciousness
- **Memory vagueness** - slight uncertainty but not overdone
- **No meta-commentary** - exemplify don't discuss, trust reader

## Themes
- Purpose and meaninglessness (whale oil for distant lamps)
- Violence without meaning
- Nested realities / layers of existence
- Rationality vs irrationality
- Obsession and fixation
- [More to emerge through writing]

## Target Audience
Adult readers who appreciate philosophical fiction, frame narratives, literary experimentation, and violence rendered without romanticism

## Status
- Started: November 23, 2025
- Current Phase: Prologue and Chapter 1 complete and refined
- Current Word Count: ~3,500 words
- Next: Continue Chapter 1 or begin next nested level
