## Logline
When a reclusive lighthouse keeper discovers a century-old journal hidden in the tower walls, she must unravel a maritime mystery that connects her own vanishing family to a shipwreck that never happened.

## Premise

Elena Rivers has spent three years alone at Widow's Point Lighthouse, maintaining the automated beacon and avoiding the mainland that holds too many memories of her missing brother. When a storm damages the tower and reveals a hidden compartment, she finds Captain James Archer's 1891 journal—detailing a rescue mission for a ship that official records claim never existed.

As Elena investigates, she discovers her brother was researching the same mystery before he disappeared. The journal entries grow increasingly desperate, describing impossible lights on the water and ships that appear only in fog. Elena must decide whether her brother found something real or succumbed to the same isolation-induced delusions that threaten her own grasp on reality.
