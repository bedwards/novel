# Project Overview

## Novel Information
- **Title**: [TBD]
- **Genre**: Philosophical Fiction / Literary Fiction
- **Target Word Count**: [TBD - likely 80,000+]
- **POV**: First Person (stable within chapters, can change between chapters)
- **Tense**: Past
- **Process**: Dean Koontz method - perfect one page at a time before moving forward

## Core Concept
Highly philosophical but pragmatic. Simplified scenes stripped down to expose truths. Multiple levels of nested frame stories (Gödel, Escher, Bach-inspired). Characters drop into new realities/frames told in first person.

## Key Structural Elements

### Frame Story Structure
- **Prologue**: Top-level frame establishing the initial hero
- **Body**: Multiple nested frame stories, characters dropping into lower realities
- **Epilogue**: Return to top-level frame from prologue
- GEB-inspired recursive structure, but not overused

### POV Rules
- First person narrator (primary)
- Narrator stable within each chapter
- Can change between chapters
- Only access to ONE person's internals at a time
- When characters drop into new reality = first person narration
- Narrator is observant, not chatty

### First Page Requirements (Deliberately Exaggerated)
Cram typical novel elements into first page to clear space for philosophical work:
- Sex (coming of age, first love - realistic, adult, not pornographic)
- Murder
- Direct action and dialogue between physically present characters
- Joseph Campbell hero's journey
- B-plot
- Coen Brothers-style intricate plot (stupidity, deception, chaos, foiled plans)
- Villain
- Insurmountable challenge
- Reluctant hero
- Mentor
- Betrayal
- Unreliable narrator
- Human turning into animal
- "Save the cat" moment for initial hero

### Writing Principles
- **Don't bury the lede** (Kurt Vonnegut) - reveal facts immediately when it's time, no cheap tricks
- **Show through action** - character traits revealed through actions/words, not narrator descriptions
- **Miller's Crossing influence** - diabolical plotting, characters of varying intelligence, rational/irrational contrast within single character, vices
- **Pragmatic philosophy** - truths exposed through simple, direct scenes

## Themes
[To be developed through writing]
- Rationality vs irrationality
- Truth revealed through simplicity
- [More to emerge]

## Target Audience
Adult readers who appreciate philosophical fiction, frame narratives, and literary experimentation

## Status
- Started: November 23, 2025
