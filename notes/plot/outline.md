# Story Outline

## Overall Structure

### Prologue
- Establishes top-level frame story
- Introduces initial hero with "save the cat" moment
- First page: deliberately packs in entire novel's worth of elements
- Sets up frame that drops into lower reality
- Will not return until epilogue

### Body (Main Narrative)
- Characters in first frame drop into lower-level realities
- Multiple nested frame stories (GEB-inspired)
- Each level told in first person
- Philosophical scenes stripped down to essentials
- Truths exposed through pragmatic action

### Epilogue
- Returns to prologue's top-level frame
- Closes the outermost story
- [Details to emerge through writing]

- Don't move forward until current page is perfect
- Frame structures emerge organically - don't force
- Philosophy revealed through action, not explanation
