# Novel Writing Principles for AI Agents

This document contains first-principle writing advice distilled from master craftspeople: Anne Lamott (*Bird by Bird*), Stephen King (*On Writing*), Dean Koontz, and other respected voices in fiction.

## Core Principles

### 1. Trust the Reader
**Principle**: Readers are intelligent and imaginative. They don't need everything explained.

**In Practice**:
- Let readers infer emotion from behavior rather than naming it
- Allow readers to discover world details organically
- Don't explain what's already clear from context
- Resist the urge to interpret scenes for the reader

**Bad**: "She was furious. Her anger made her slam the door."
**Good**: "She slammed the door."

### 2. Show, Don't Tell (Except When Telling Is Better)
**Principle**: Dramatize important moments. Summarize unimportant ones.

**When to Show**:
- Emotional turning points
- Character-revealing moments
- Plot-critical events
- First introductions to important elements

**When to Tell**:
- Transitions between important scenes
- Routine actions that don't advance plot or character
- Background information needed for context
- Time passages

**Example of Good Telling**: "Three weeks passed before she called him back."

### 3. Concrete Beats Abstract
**Principle**: Specific, sensory details create reality. Abstractions create distance.

**In Practice**:
- Use specific nouns and verbs, not generic ones
- Engage multiple senses
- Ground abstract emotions in physical sensations
- Choose the particular over the general

**Abstract**: "The room was messy."
**Concrete**: "Socks hung from the lampshade. Coffee rings stained the stack of unopened mail."

### 4. Kill Your Darlings (But Know What That Means)
**Principle**: Cut anything that serves the writer's ego more than the story.

**What to Cut**:
- Purple prose that calls attention to itself
- Clever metaphors that don't illuminate
- Information the reader doesn't need yet (or ever)
- Scenes that exist only because you enjoyed writing them

**What to Keep**:
- Beautiful language that also does narrative work
- Moments that feel right even if you can't explain why
- Passages that make the story more itself

### 5. Character Voice Is Everything
**Principle**: Each character should think, speak, and perceive in ways unique to them.

**In Practice**:
- Word choice reflects background, education, age
- Sentence structure reveals thinking patterns
- What a character notices shows what they value
- How they describe things shows how they see the world

**Test**: Cover the dialogue tag. Can you still tell who's speaking?

### 6. Plot Is Character Under Pressure
**Principle**: Plot should emerge from character decisions, not vice versa.

**In Practice**:
- Know what each character wants and fears
- Put obstacles between characters and their desires
- Make characters choose between bad options
- Let consequences flow from choices

**Not**: "The plot requires her to go into the basement."
**Yes**: "She goes into the basement because she believes her daughter is down there."

### 7. Tension on Every Page
**Principle**: Not action, not conflict—tension. The reader's need to know what happens next.

**Sources of Tension**:
- Unanswered questions
- Delayed information
- Competing desires
- Uncertainty about outcomes
- Dread of what might come
- Desire for what might not

**Note**: Tension ≠ drama. A quiet conversation can crackle with tension.

### 8. Dialogue Should Do More Than One Thing
**Principle**: Good dialogue simultaneously reveals character, advances plot, and sounds natural.

**In Practice**:
- Subtext: What they mean vs. what they say
- Conflict: Even agreement can contain tension
- Rhythm: How they speak reveals who they are
- Action: Dialogue interweaves with physical behavior

**Avoid**:
- On-the-nose dialogue (saying exactly what you mean)
- Pure exposition dumps
- Dialogue that exists only to convey information
- Real-life levels of small talk and meandering

### 9. Start Late, Leave Early
**Principle**: Begin scenes as late as possible; end them before they're fully resolved.

**In Practice**:
- Cut greetings, arrivals, physical movements
- Start with the first interesting thing
- End with a decision, revelation, or question
- Leave readers wanting more, not satisfied

**Bad**: "She drove across town, parked, walked into the building, took the elevator..."
**Good**: "The office was empty when she arrived."

### 10. Point of View Is a Sacred Trust
**Principle**: Maintain consistent POV distance and knowledge within scenes.

**In Practice**:
- Stay in one character's experience per scene (unless omniscient)
- Only describe what the POV character can perceive
- Filter everything through their knowledge and understanding
- Don't head-hop without a scene break

**POV Violation**: "She smiled, not knowing he was hiding a gun."
**Correct**: "She smiled. Behind his back, his hand found the gun."

### 11. Specific Details Beat General Descriptions
**Principle**: One telling detail outweighs paragraphs of general description.

**In Practice**:
- Choose the detail that captures the whole
- Let details do double duty (reveal character + setting)
- Avoid laundry lists of features
- Select details the POV character would notice

**Generic**: "He was old and looked tired."
**Specific**: "His knuckles were swollen, the wedding ring embedded in flesh."

### 12. Rhythm and Pacing Through Sentence Structure
**Principle**: Sentence length and structure control reading speed and emotional intensity.

**In Practice**:
- Short sentences = urgency, clarity, impact
- Long sentences = contemplation, complexity, flowing
- Vary structure to avoid monotony
- Match rhythm to content

**Action**: "She ran. The footsteps behind her grew louder. Closer."
**Reflection**: "She had always known, in some distant way that never quite became conscious thought, that this day would come."

### 13. Writing Is Rewriting
**Principle**: First drafts are for discovery. Subsequent drafts are for craft.

**In Practice**:
- Give yourself permission to write badly first
- Separate drafting from editing (different brain modes)
- Read your work aloud to catch awkwardness
- Be willing to cut large sections
- Sometimes "fixing" means starting over

**Remember**: No one sees the drafts. They only see the finished work.

### 14. The Red Herring Principle
**Principle**: Necessary information should appear before it's needed.

**In Practice**:
- Introduce elements before they become crucial
- Make important details seem unimportant at first
- The gun on the wall in Act 1 should fire by Act 3
- Don't pull solutions out of thin air

**Cheating**: A character suddenly remembers they know lockpicking
**Setup**: Earlier scene shows them fidgeting with a padlock

### 15. Emotional Truth Over Factual Accuracy
**Principle**: The story should feel true even when inventing.

**In Practice**:
- Capture authentic emotional experiences
- Honest character reactions even in fantastical situations
- Research is for plausibility, not for showing off
- When research and story conflict, story wins (but acknowledge it)

### 16. Avoid Wan Intensifiers
**Principle**: Very, really, quite, rather, and similar words usually weaken prose.

**In Practice**:
- "Very tired" → "exhausted"
- "Really angry" → "furious"
- "Walked quickly" → "hurried"
- Find the stronger word instead of modifying a weak one

**From Mark Twain**: "Substitute 'damn' every time you're inclined to write 'very'; your editor will delete it and the writing will be just as it should be."

### 17. Active Versus Passive (Know the Difference)
**Principle**: Active voice creates immediacy. Passive voice creates distance.

**Use Active Voice When**:
- Showing action
- Maintaining pace
- Emphasizing the actor
- Creating immediacy

**Use Passive Voice When**:
- The actor is unknown or unimportant
- You want to emphasize what was done, not who did it
- Creating deliberate distance
- Avoiding responsibility (character voice)

**Active**: "She opened the letter."
**Passive**: "The letter was opened." (Use this if you want mystery about who opened it)

### 18. Compression Creates Power
**Principle**: Say more with less. Every word should earn its place.

**In Practice**:
- Cut filter words: saw, felt, heard, noticed, seemed
- Eliminate redundancy
- Replace phrases with words
- Let strong verbs replace weak verbs + adverbs

**Wordy**: "She felt sad when she saw that he was leaving."
**Compressed**: "He was leaving. Her throat tightened."

### 19. Metaphor and Simile Should Illuminate, Not Decorate
**Principle**: Figurative language should create understanding or feeling, not just prettiness.

**Good Metaphor**:
- Reveals something new about the thing described
- Fits the character's voice and knowledge
- Doesn't draw attention to its own cleverness
- Does narrative work beyond decoration

**Bad**: "Her hair was like a cascading waterfall of golden honey."
**Good**: "Her hair had the brittle texture of over-processing."

### 20. Know What Story You're Telling
**Principle**: Every story is about something beyond its plot.

**In Practice**:
- What question is this story asking?
- What does the protagonist learn or become?
- What changes between beginning and end?
- What do you want readers to feel?

**Note**: You don't need to know this when you start, but you should know it by the time you finish.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### The Weather Report Opening
Starting with weather or setting description before grounding the reader in character and situation.

**Instead**: Begin with character in motion (physical or emotional).

### The As-You-Know-Bob
Characters telling each other things they both already know, purely for the reader's benefit.

**Instead**: Find ways to dramatize information or weave it naturally into action.

### The Maid and Butler
Similar to above: two characters discussing exposition while doing something mundane.

**Instead**: Reveal information through conflict, discovery, or necessity.

### The Talking Heads
Long dialogue exchanges with no physical grounding, action, or internal thought.

**Instead**: Interweave dialogue with gesture, movement, sensation, and thought.

### The Epilogue Scene
Scenes that wrap everything up neatly, answer every question, and leave nothing to the imagination.

**Instead**: Trust the reader to understand implications. Leave some mystery.

### The Adverb Crutch
Using adverbs to modify weak verbs instead of finding stronger verbs.

**Weak**: "She walked quickly to the door."
**Strong**: "She hurried to the door."

### The Grocery List Description
Describing characters or settings by listing features sequentially.

**Instead**: Select revealing details filtered through POV and integrated with action.

## Genre-Specific Considerations

While these principles apply broadly, recognize that:

- **Thriller/Mystery**: Pacing and information control are paramount
- **Romance**: Emotional authenticity and chemistry matter most
- **Literary**: Language and theme may take precedence over plot
- **Fantasy/SF**: World-building must balance clarity with momentum
- **Horror**: Atmosphere and dread trump explanation

Adjust your approach based on genre expectations while maintaining core craft principles.

## The Anne Lamott Principle: Shitty First Drafts

**Remember**: "All good writers write them. This is how they end up with good second drafts and terrific third drafts."

- Perfectionism kills productivity
- Get the story out first, fix it later
- Discovery happens in drafting
- You can't edit a blank page

## The Stephen King Principle: Kill Adverbs

"The road to hell is paved with adverbs."

- Adverbs often indicate weak verb choice
- Show action; don't modify it
- Particularly in dialogue tags: "he said" is almost always enough

## The Dean Koontz Principle: Engage the Senses

"Description should be filtered through the character's emotions and perceptions."

- Use all five senses
- Ground readers in physical reality
- Let setting reflect character's emotional state
- Details are emotional, not just visual

## Final Wisdom

**Write like a human, not like an AI**:
- Embrace imperfection and idiosyncrasy
- Let characters be contradictory
- Allow scenes to breathe unevenly
- Trust intuition over formula
- Remember that rules are descriptive, not prescriptive

**The only rule that never breaks**: Serve the story.
